# GAME IDEA

Meta RPG:

A super rare RPG from the 1990s written by a genius programmer has great critical acclaim.

A voiceless protagonist, a games reviewer, is approached by the genius programmer in the present day, he has a special version of the game he never released at the time, with some kind of innovative feature that immersese you in the game and wants the protagonist to review it.

This story is told as a LIVE ACTION SEQUENCE.

- You ARE the protagonist, filmed POV

You SEE the game you are about to play being played in this live action sequence.

The protagonist gets sucked into  or emersed in the game somehow - the version of the game has him as a protagonist and the programmer as the antagonist. The programmer has grown insane and targeted the protagonist because of a previous bad review for a game he had previously worked on. He must beat the game in order to escape being captivated by it.

YOU play the game the protagonist is playing:
- its a 2D action RPG with farming elements
- The main story is the battle to escape the game, but the sidequests are the original game
- The antagonist is a god like figure, and appears offering a directors commentary about how he made the game in parts, and how innovative it is:
	- We can make it innovative **As a 90s 2D game**, he can comment on how its got a day and night cycle, farming elements, fully voice acted, etc.
