# Command Line Args

Pass command line args from your game to the engine via the `EngineStart` function.

The engine accepts the following command line args, mostly relating to networking and logging:

- `--role` - networking role (`-r`)
  - valid options:
    - `client`
    - `server`
- `--server_addres` - server IP and port (`-s`)
- `--client_address` - client IP and port (`-c`)
- `--log_level` - drop logs that are below this level (`-l`)
  - valid options (increasing severity):
    - `verbose` (`v`)
    - `info` (`i`)
    - `warning` (`w`)
    - `error` (`e`)
- `--disable_log_colour` - don't use ansii colour codes in logs (looks nicer when loggin to a file)
- `--disable_log_timestamp` - don't add a timestamp to logs
- `--logfile` - file to log to (as well as to console)
- `--disable_log_tid` - don't include thread id in the logged messages
- `--disable_console_log` - don't log to console (but still log to file if one chosen)
- `--network_sim_config` - path to network simulator config file to use

If unknown args are encountered they're just ignored so your game can handle its own arguments and then pass argc and argv
